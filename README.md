# Pace Manager
Pace time calculator to rank teams based on a provided goal time


## Developer Notes

- Redo the entire thing. Organize UI into Stages, Parents, Nodes, etc.
- Launcher/Entry point should be a `main.java` class in the base directory
- Completely rework tests (separate thread)
- Fix the .idea folder
- Change dynamic id to just append off of the largest ID value in the Identifier enum (rename this to something like "Identity" or "I"?)
