## What is this project?

For several years, I've helped out at a local bridle-land association, where I run the calculations and determine the
winners. The current method, however (until this project nears completion) is through the use of an old excel
spreadsheet with many macros. Year after year, this method gets more clunky and questionable, and begs to be replaced.

This is my answer. It began as a quick project I had hoped to finish before the next event, but sadly did not make it.
Since then, I've rebuilt it over and over, really marking my progression in programming. I've started over multiple
times, each time learning something from the previous iteration and trying to use something different.

While I do have a (very old) release package, I wouldn't consider that an effectively completed project. This might be
me just not wanting to even think about looking at the code, and I'm sure it still works. I just don't remember it being
very good. I have yet to finish a version to a release standard, and we're on... what, `2.0.0`?

## Setting up

### Development Environment

This project is currently being developed using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) using Java Version 17.
Loading the project in **Intellij IDEA** should automatically detect and prompt to set up Java 17.

### Running the Project

Currently, the project currently does not have any launch point. I am building form the back-end up, and taking time to
make sure the back-end is effectively setup before looking at the UI.
