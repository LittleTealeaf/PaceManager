Have a suggestion? See something that you think I could improve? Better practices? Perfect!
I'd love all the input I could get in regards to this project if you're willing to help. Feel free to fork off, make
changes, and create a pull request and I'll take a look at the changes and merge it if it feels fit!

I do have both CodeQL and pmd running tests on each commit and pull request. I'll typically look at those results, but if you've got something that these CI tests don't cover, let me know and I will take a closer look at it!
